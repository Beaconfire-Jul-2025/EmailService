Before running the application, set the following environment variables:

| Variable        | Description                               |

### üê≥ Run with Docker

This service includes a `Dockerfile`. You can build and run it using:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t email-service .

# Run the container
docker run -d \
  -e MAIL_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com \
  -e MAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password \
  -e MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com \
  -e MAIL_PORT=587 \
  -p 8085:8085 \
  email-service
```

The service will be accessible at: `http://localhost:8085`

## üì¨ RabbitMQ Configuration

This service listens to RabbitMQ messages to trigger email sending.

* **Exchange Name:** `emailExchange`
* **Queue Name:** `emailQueue`
* **Exchange Type:** `direct`

You must ensure that RabbitMQ is running and the appropriate exchange and queue are created. The service will attempt to create these automatically on startup if they don‚Äôt exist.

## ‚úÖ Example Use Case

Send a message to RabbitMQ with a payload similar to:

```json
{
  "to": "recipient@example.com",
  "subject": "Welcome!",
  "body": "Thank you for joining us!"
}
```

The service will consume this message and send an email using the configured SMTP provider.
